# Research

The goal of my research is to enable a group of agents to control a dynamical system in a decentralized fashion through game-theoretic learning.
This requires crafting a game whose equilibria are desirable controllers for the dynamical system and equipping the agents with learning rules that guarantee convergence to an equilibrium.

I study stochastic games in which the full-rationality requirement of game theory is restrictive.
To circumvent this restriction, I introduced a bounded-rationality solution concept called empirical-evidence equilibrium (EEE).
In the EEE framework, agents use low-order empirical models of observed quantities.
These models are statistically consistent when the empirical evidence observed by an agent does not contradict its model.
In an EEE, each agent has a consistent model of its opponents and plays a best response to its model.
I am currently analyzing properties of EEEs.
