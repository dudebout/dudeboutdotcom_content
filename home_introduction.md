  I am a PhD candidate at the [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.gatech.edu) advised by [Professor Jeff Shamma](http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~jshamma3/) and [Professor Éric Féron](http://www.feron.org/Eric/).
  My research focus is control theory with an emphasis on game theoretic learning.
  I received a Bachelor's degree from [Supélec](http://www.supelec.fr) in 2007 and a Master's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008.

  I am a strong believer in the benefits of reproducible research. Therefore, all the material needed to regenerate [my publications and presentations](publications) is available on GitHub.
