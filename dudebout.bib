  abstract     = "The framework of empirical-evidence equilibrium (EEE) for stochastic games is developed in this paper.
In a stochastic game, agents collectively influence the dynamic of the environment.
In standard equilibria, each agent's strategy is optimal with respect to its opponents' strategies.
Therefore, each strategy is the solution to a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
The following considerations motivate the notion of EEE.
First, solutions to a POMDP can be prohibitively complex to compute and implement.
Second, agents might not fully understand the environment's dynamic.
Third, standard equilibria do not accommodate different levels of bounded rationality among agents.
Finally, reaching equilibrium in stochastic games has not been adequately addressed.
In the EEE framework, each agent formulates a simple model of its opponents' effects.
It neglects that agents are mutually dependent through the environment and computes an optimal strategy associated with its model.
The agents play their strategies against each other and make some observations.
Agents are in EEE when the models are consistent with these empirical observations.
In this paper, the notion of EEE is formalized and an existence result is established in a general setting.
Relations with other equilibria, including mean-field equilibria, are also presented.
Finally, the learning of EEEs by simple adaptive processes is illustrated through simulation."

  abstract     = "This paper presents the first ultra low power (5 mW) multi-gigabit pulse-shaping filter and clock data recovery circuits fully integrated in a 90-nm CMOS wireless digital radio meeting the specifications of 60 GHz wireless standards.
The architecture features a 4.4 Gsps capable 13-tap FIR pulse shaping filter on the TX side, and a dual loop clock data recovery with on-chip loop filter on the RX side to suppress the high frequency jitter introduced by the pulse shaping.
Using a fully integrated 60 GHz TDD transceiver embedding the presented solution, a 95% reduction of the high frequency jitter has been measured at the standard nominal 1.728 Gbps data rate.
The solution features a minimal power overhead of 5 mW from 1 V voltage supply."

This thesis presents a system on chip which demonstrates the potential of 60 GHz transceivers.
This system is based on an FPGA board on which a GNU/Linux kernel has been run.
This document will give some insight on the design process as well as on the finished product.
Both the hardware and the software parts of the design are presented."
