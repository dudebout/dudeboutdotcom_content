  abstract     = "The framework of empirical-evidence equilibrium (EEE) for stochastic games is developed in this paper.
In a stochastic game, agents collectively influence the dynamic of the environment.
In standard equilibria, each agent's strategy is optimal with respect to its opponents' strategies.
Therefore, each strategy is the solution to a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).
The following considerations motivate the notion of EEE.
First, solutions to a POMDP can be prohibitively complex to compute and implement.
Second, agents might not fully understand the environment's dynamic.
Third, standard equilibria do not accommodate different levels of bounded rationality among agents.
Finally, reaching equilibrium in stochastic games has not been adequately addressed.
In the EEE framework, each agent formulates a simple model of its opponents' effects.
It neglects that agents are mutually dependent through the environment and computes an optimal strategy associated with its model.
The agents play their strategies against each other and make some observations.
Agents are in EEE when the models are consistent with these empirical observations.
In this paper, the notion of EEE is formalized and an existence result is established in a general setting.
Relations with other equilibria, including mean-field equilibria, are also presented.
Finally, the learning of EEEs by simple adaptive processes is illustrated through simulation."

  abstract     = "The objective of the proposed research is to develop the framework of empirical evidence equilibria (EEEs) in stochastic games and to design decentralized controllers using learning in that framework.
The goal is to enable a set of agents to control a dynamical system in a decentralized fashion.
To do so, the agents play a stochastic game crafted such that its equilibria are decentralized controllers for the dynamical system.
Unfortunately, there exists no algorithm to compute equilibria in stochastic games.
One explanation for this lack of results is the full-rationality requirement of game theory.
In the case of stochastic games, full rationality imposes that two requirements be met at equilibrium.
First, each agent has a perfect model of the game and of its opponents' strategies.
Second, each agent plays an optimal strategy for the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) induced by its opponents' strategies.
Both requirements are unrealistic.
An agent cannot know the strategies of its opponents; it can only observe the combined effect of its own strategy interacting with its opponents'.
Furthermore, POMDPs are intractable; an agent cannot compute an optimal strategy in a reasonable time.
In addition to these two requirements, engineered agents cannot carry perfect analytical reasoning and have limited memory; they naturally exhibit bounded rationality.
In the proposed research, bounded rationality is not seen as a limitation and is instead used to relax the two requirements.
In the EEE framework, agents formulate low-order empirical models of observed quantities called mockups.
Mockups have unmodeled states and dynamic effects, but they are statistically consistent; the empirical evidence observed by an agent does not contradict its mockup.
Each agent uses its mockup to derive an optimal strategy.
Since agents are interconnected through the system, these mockups are sensitive to the specific strategies employed by other agents.
In an EEE, the two requirements are weakened.
First, each agent has a consistent mockup of the game and the strategies of its opponents.
Second, each agent plays an optimal strategy for the Markov decision process (MDP) induced by its mockup.
The EEE framework provides a new solution concept for stochastic games.
This solution concept has been contrasted to other classical notions.
General conditions for the existence of EEEs have been derived.
The properties of EEEs will be investigated.
The EEE framework will be used to solve decentralized control problems through the design of an algorithm converging to EEEs."

The architecture features a 4.4 Gsps capable 13-tap FIR pulse shaping filter on the TX side, and a dual loop clock data recovery with on-chip loop filter on the RX side to suppress the high frequency jitter introduced by the pulse shaping.
Using a fully integrated 60 GHz TDD transceiver embedding the presented solution, a 95% reduction of the high frequency jitter has been measured at the standard nominal 1.728 Gbps data rate.
The solution features a minimal power overhead of 5 mW from 1 V voltage supply."
